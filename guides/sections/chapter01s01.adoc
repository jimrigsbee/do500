== Deploying an Application to an OpenShift Cluster

=== Objectives
After completing this section, students should be able to:

* Deploy an application to the cluster from a Dockerfile with the CLI.
* Describe the resources created in a project by the *oc new-app* command
and the web console.

.Deployment Scenarios
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is designed for building and deploying
containerized applications:
** Complete application life cycle is managed using OpenShift tools
** Existing containerized applications are built outside of OpenShift
* *oc new-app* command creates resources to build (optional) and deploy
|===

.Building and Deploying with CLI
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* *oc new-app* command:
** Pass a URL that points to a Git repository or a container image
* Command decides what type of application to build and/or deploy:
** Source-to-Image
** Dockerfile
** Docker Image
|===

.Specifying the Builder Image
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* Specifying a builder image stream on the Git URL:
----
oc new-app php~http://gitserver.example.com/mygitrepo
----
* Specifying a builder image stream with the image stream argument:
----
oc new-app -i php http://gitserver.example.com/mygitrepo
----
|===

.Deploying Existing Containerized Applications
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* Specify the registry and image name:
----
oc new-app registry.example.com/mycontainerimage
----
|===

.Deploying Existing Dockerfiles
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* Specify the Git repository that contains the Dockerfile
----
oc new-app http://gitserver.example.com/mydockerfilerepo
----
|===

.Disambiguation Options for *oc new-app*
[options="header", width="100%",cols="1,3"]
|===
| Option | Description
| *--image-stream* or *i*
| Provides the image stream to be used as either the S2I builder image for an S2I
build or to deploy a container image.
| *--strategy*
| Provides the build strategy, usually *docker* or *source*
| *--code*
| Provides the URL to a Git repository to be used as input to an S2I build.
| *--docker-image*
| Provides the URL to a container image to be deployed.
|===

.Generated Resources
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* Resources created by *oc new-app* command:
** Build Configuration
** Image Stream
** Deployment Configuration
** Service for all ports exposed
* These resources create other Kubernetes resources
|===

.Image Streams
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* An _image stream_ resource refers to container images and caches their metadata
* Build and Deployment configurations use image stream events to trigger behavior:
** Trigger a new S2I build when the builder image changes
** Trigger a new deployment when the application container image changes
* To create a new image stream use the *oc import-image* command:
----
oc import-image myis --confirm \
   --from registry.acme.example.com:5000/acme/awesome --insecure
----
|===

[[webconsole_projects]]
.Web console projects listing
image::webconsole-projects.png[]

.Image Stream Tags
[width="100%",cols="1a"]
|===
|
* An _image stream tag_ points to a particular container image in an image stream
** *ruby:2.0* refers to *openshift3/ruby-20-rhel7*
** *ruby:2.2* refers to *openshift3/ruby-22-rhel7*
* An image stream can have one or more tags
* Note web console projects listing in figure <<webconsole_projects>>
