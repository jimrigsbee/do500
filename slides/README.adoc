= DO500 DevOps Culture and Practice Enablement
This is the repository for the assets belonging to the Red Hat Training course DO500.
This course repository does not follow usual conventions because the lab environment differs from the standard one and the course guides are not written in Docbook.

== Classroom Environment
The classroom is built using the *casl-ansible* playbooks from the
Red Hat Communities of Practice (redhat-cop).
These playbooks and their corresponding galaxy dependencies build an
OpenShift cluster in the cloud (AWS in this case).
The playbooks also create any added infrastructure needed such as
an Identity Management server. The environment is easily scalable
based on the inventory file.  Provided here are inventories for
testing and production usage.
